## Previous Repo
This is a refactored version of https://github.com/sheleoni/hiragana-icecream , which previously was deployed on Netlify using Vite. 
In order to add login functions, we have refactored the game into NextJS + AuthJS (aka NextAuth). 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# 2) Gameplay
- Click the pronunciation of the hiragana / katakana character shown
- If you answer correctly for the same character consecutively, the tide level in the hexgon rises
- Once a hexagon is filled, you can click on it to unlock a new ice-cream scoop!

# 3) Testing on your computer

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
